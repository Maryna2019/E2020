            <p class="article-text">Last year’s summer was so warm that it helped trigger the loss of 600bn tons of ice from Greenland – enough to raise global sea 
            levels by 2.2mm in just two months, new research has found.The analysis of satellite data has revealed the astounding loss of ice in just a few months of abnormally 
            high temperatures around the northern pole. Last year was the hottest on record for the Arctic, with the
            annual minimum extent of sea ice in the region its second-lowest on record.</p>
            <blockquote>“We knew this <em>past summer had been particularly warm in Greenland </em>, melting every corner of the ice sheet, but the numbers are 
            enormous” said Isabella Velicogna, a professor of Earth system science at University of California Irvine and lead author of the new study, 
            which drew upon measurements taken <abbr title="Nasa’s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment "> GRACE </abbr>by 
            satellite mission and its upgraded successor.
            </blockquote>
            <p class="article-text"> Unlike the retreat of sea ice, the loss of land-based glaciers directly causes the seas to rise, imperiling coastal cities and towns around the world. Scientists have calculated that Greenland’s
            enormous ice sheet lost an average of 268bn tons of ice between 2002 and 2019 – less than half of what was shed last summer.
            By contrast,  country, which has more than <mark> 10 million residents </mark> consumes 1bn tons of water a year.</p>

            <p class="article-text">You may be at the mercy of others with your schedule – particularly if you work in
            a team, but if you can work independently – seize the day early.Ernest Hemingway started writing at 6am each morning and had the fairly 
            consistent routine of a mid-level accountant – not the loose unit that he was in his non-writing life.</p>
